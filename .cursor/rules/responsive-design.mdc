# Responsive Design Guidelines

## Mobile-First Approach
- Design for mobile devices first, then enhance for larger screens
- Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`
- Test on actual devices and browser dev tools
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44px for mobile accessibility

## Breakpoint Strategy
- **Mobile**: Default (320px+)
- **Small**: `sm:` (640px+)
- **Medium**: `md:` (768px+)
- **Large**: `lg:` (1024px+)
- **Extra Large**: `xl:` (1280px+)
- **2X Large**: `2xl:` (1536px+)

## Weather Dashboard Specific Layouts

### Mobile Layout (< 768px)
- Single column layout for weather cards
- Stack city selector and add city form vertically
- Use full-width cards with minimal padding
- Implement horizontal scrolling for 7-day forecast if needed
- Collapsible navigation and filters

### Tablet Layout (768px - 1024px)
- Two-column grid for weather cards
- Side-by-side city selector and add city form
- Moderate padding and spacing
- Show 3-4 days per row in forecast

### Desktop Layout (> 1024px)
- Multi-column grid (3-4 weather cards per row)
- Horizontal layout for controls
- Generous padding and spacing
- Show all 7 days in a single row
- Sidebar for additional features

## Typography Scaling
- Use responsive text sizes: `text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg`
- Maintain readable line heights across devices
- Ensure text remains legible on small screens
- Use appropriate font weights for different screen sizes

## Touch and Interaction
- Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements
- Swipe gestures for forecast navigation
- Hover states for desktop, active states for mobile

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize images for different screen densities
- Use responsive images with `srcset`
- Lazy load images below the fold
- Minimize layout shifts during responsive changes

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify landscape and portrait orientations
- [ ] Check touch interactions work properly
- [ ] Ensure text remains readable at all sizes
- [ ] Validate navigation works on all screen sizes
- [ ] Verify no horizontal scrolling on mobile
